Process:-->

I've done following task to make a desirable table.
1.) for simplicity purpose ,i've converted .xlsx file into .csv format with the help of pandas library .
2.) Pandas is very useful library (for data manipulation) . i used it throughout the coding part.
3.) Using pandas i've read, removed redundant data like duplicate , null values . after that i gave the header/column and index to dataset


 ===> Here i've divided dataset into two halves one for Opening Rank and another for Closing Rank.

4.) I converted into desirable format.
5.) I sorted the dataset by 'Rank predictor' in ascending order.
6.) I asked the rank , category and order in order to get the College Name and Department Name based on opening rank and closing rank.


Now table contains 4 columns and 847 rows.
